                    <hr/>
                    <p>Reading has been a hobby of mine for as long as I could remember. Books stimulate imagination, expand horizon, and transport readers into surreal worlds and realms, all at little to no cost.</p>
                    <p>I have a predisposition for classic science fiction novels, notably those written by H. G. Wells. His futuristic ideas, contrasted with his living in an era before the Scientific Revolution, render his capacity of imagination especially impressive and intriguing. Moreover, his works are not merely entertaining at face valueâ€” there is often a deeper political or philosophical nuance left for readers to unearth.</p>
                    <p>I also like to read philosophy, through which I have acquired a greater understanding of myself and my surroundings at large. John Locke, in particular, fascinates me. His liberal ideas and renegade nature against authority renders him an enigmatic philosopher who is far ahead of his time. I recommend everyone to check out John Locke, in particular his Two Treatises of Government.</p>
