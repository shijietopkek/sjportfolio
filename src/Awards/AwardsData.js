        description:'Our victory in IMDA NIC Face-Off App development 2016 secured us a sponsored trip to Taipei to participate in the Asia Pacific ICT Alliance (APICTA) Awards. By then, we have more or less optimised our SocialShield application. With a user-friendly interface and additional features such as sentiment analysis, we were ready to introduce our project to the global community. After 5D4N worth of intense preparations and presentations, we were able to clinch the merit award. We learnt new things, experienced new culture and most importantly, thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. It was one of my most memorable experience in school.',

        description:'Within a short time frame and with zero prior experience, I was able to pick up Tableau skills fast and create a data-driven dashboard which is both insightful and visually-appealing. We eventually clinched second place and was at the top in terms of public popularity, which saw us winning the "Most Well-liked Viz" award as well. This competition is significant to me for two reasons. Firstly, as a team leader, I was given the opportunity to demonstrate my leadership skills. Secondly, it introduced me to the subject of Big Data and data analytics, which gradually evolved into a sustained passion.',

        description:'For someone whose prior experience in programming is limited to Python, C++ was a steep learning curve for me. But it was the prerequisite for NOI, so with little choice I grit my teeth and set about conquering it. The competition opened my eyes to a world beyond Python, where not everything is as smooth, simple and straightforward as desired. In the end, I was glad to have acquired C++ skills, albeit at an entry level.',
